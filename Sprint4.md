# Note-It Sprint 4 Overview

## Create New Note
- User can write notes in the editor and save them clicking on 'Save Note' in the hamburger icon. In Sprint 4 we changed the tag option to be different 'colors' instead of user-input text. User can navigate to the editor from Archive page, by clicking 'New Note' in the hamburger icon.

## Delete Note with Confirmation
- User can delete an existing note by clicking on the 'DELETE' option in the corresponding Note Card in the Archive page. In Sprint 4 we added confirmation to prevent accidental deletions. This hard deletes the note from Firestore.

## Filter Notes by Tag
- Users can filter their notes based on the tags they were given when they were saved. Tags can be edited just like note titles and content.
